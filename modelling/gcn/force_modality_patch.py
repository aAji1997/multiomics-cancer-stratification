"""
This script patches the IntegratedTransformerGCN model to force modality-by-modality processing.
It completely disables the decode_omics method and replaces it with a version that always
processes one modality at a time.

Usage:
1. Import this file before creating the model
2. The patch will be automatically applied

Example:
```python
import modelling.gcn.force_modality_patch  # This will apply the patch
from modelling.gcn.integrated_transformer_gcn_model import IntegratedTransformerGCN
```
